# my-awesome-wm-theme
This is my awesome theme, works on arch and debian


In the rc in the last line, you have to make sure to install picom for arch, or compton for debian
You need the "light" programm to dim the light and the "acpi" programm, to show the battery life.

First, you need to install awesome. 
myTheme folder has to be placed in /usr/share/awesome/themes
the rc has to be placed in /home/username/.config/awesome   if there is none, you can make one

The rc uses alacritty as terminal and vim as texteditor
